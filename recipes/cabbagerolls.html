      In this stuffed cabbage roll recipe, cabbage leaves are filled with a
      flavorful beef mixture and topped with an easy homemade sauce.

    <p>
      This cabbage rolls recipe is super easy to prep with cabbage leaves,
      ground beef, rice, and condensed tomato soup. I have been using this
      recipe for well over 20 years and still love it! To speed things up the
      rolls are cooked in a skillet on the stovetop but this recipe also works
      well in a slow cooker.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2/3 cup water</li>
      <li>1/3 cup uncooked white rice</li>
      <li>8 cabbage leaves</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 egg, slightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed tomato soup, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to low, cover,
        and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, bring a large, wide saucepan of lightly salted water to a
        boil. Add cabbage leaves and cook for 2 to 4 minutes or until softened;
        drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine ground beef, 1 cup of cooked rice, onion, egg, 2 tablespoons of
        tomato soup, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon about 2 tablespoons of beef mixture onto each cabbage leaf; bring
        one end of the cabbage leaf over the mixture, rolling and tucking in the
        ends to prevent the filling from falling out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cabbage rolls in a large skillet over medium heat; pour remaining
        tomato soup on top. Cover and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and
        simmer for about 40 minutes, stirring and basting with the liquid often.
      </li>
